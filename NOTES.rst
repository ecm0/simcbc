Notes
=====

1. Check the rate of event with events > 7 (?) if simulation
   is done with O1 [should get a fraction of BNS for 6 month run]

2. declinations of mergers.txt don't look right -- FIXED

3. check that all angles in generate_xml_tables.py are all in degrees -- FIXED
      
4. LAL Error - XLALSimInspiralDecomposeWaveformString (LALSimInspiral.c:4045): Invalid waveform string `TaylorT4'.

5. Check merger rate in Table 2 of Dominik et al 2012. Fix according to
   assumption on metallicity.
