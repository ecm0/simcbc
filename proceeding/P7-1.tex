\begin{abstract}
  By extrapolating the number of detections made during the first LIGO science
  run, tenths of gravitational wave signals from binary black hole mergers are
  anticipated in upcoming LIGO Virgo science runs. Finding an electromagnetic
  counterpart from compact binary merger events would be a capital achievement.
%if we want to solve some raised issues from the September 2015 event. 
  We evaluate the ability of current wide-field X- and gamma-ray telescopes
  aboard INTEGRAL to find such counterparts thanks to an end-to-end simulation
  for estimating the fraction of the sources that can be followed up and/or
  detected.

On September 14, 2015, the two LIGO interferometers realized the first direct detection of
gravitational waves (GW). A next step would be to associate an electromagnetic (EM)
counterpart to a GW event. We address the question of the joint detectability 
of GW events by Advanced LIGO, and associated EM events at high-energies by the 
INTEGRAL mission. This study is similar to that of \citep{2016arXiv160606124P} done with Fermi.

\section*{Monte-Carlo simulation of gravitational-wave events from neutron-star binary mergers}

We start with a simulated catalogue of 6 millions Milky Way-like galaxies
distributed to $z\sim 0.12$. To those galaxies, we associate binary neutron star
(BNS) mergers with mass distribution and rate $R=23.5 \mathrm{Myr}^{-3}$ per galaxy
according to Model A (solar metallicity) of
\citep{2012ApJ...759...52D}. This results in a population of 14\,000
mergers for a $100$ year simulation.

We simulate GW signals corresponding to the binary mergers (using model
``TaylorT4'') and inject them into Gaussian noise coloured according to the
``optimistic'' power-spectral density anticipated for the 2nd LIGO/Virgo run O2
\citep{2016LRR....19....1A}. \textcolor{blue}{We select signals with $\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{combined}} > 9$.}
corresponding to a false-alarm rate $\mathrm{FAR} < 1/\mathrm{month}$. \textcolor{blue}{The
average range BNS is 126 Mpc for this selection.}

This results in \textcolor{blue}{232 selected merger signals over 100 years which corresponds to
$\sim 1$ merger over the 6-month duration of O2.} We distribute those events
randomly in time over the expected period of O2 from Nov 2016 to May 2017. We
recover GW signals using matched-filtering techniques and reconstruct the
posterior skymaps giving the position of the source using the BAYESTAR pipeline
\citep{2016PhRvD..93b4013S}.  \textcolor{blue}{With two detectors only, the position uncertainty is
large and contained in a window of 700--2000 square degrees.}

\section*{Electromagnetic emission model from neutron-star binary mergers}

Compact binary mergers involving at least one neutron star are considered to be
plausible progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts (GRB). Short GRBs is a
subset of the whole GRB population with duration shorter than $\sim$2
seconds. Short GRBs have also a harder spectrum. Prompt emission is attributed
to dissipation within the collimated ultra-relativistic jet and is therefore
strongly beamed. It is followed by slowly decaying afterglow, observed from
radio to GeV, produced by the interaction between the ejecta and the ambient
medium surrounding the GRB progenitor. Afterglow emission is originally also
strongly beamed, but as the outflow decelerates, the emission becomes
progressively more isotropic.

In our simulation we assume that every BNS merger is associated with a short
gamma-ray burst. We simulate synthetic prompt GRB and a hard X-ray afterglow,
assuming the following simplified model.

\subsection*{Prompt emission}

We model the prompt emission spectrum by the cut-off power-law model. This model
is a variant of the Band model \citep{1993ApJ...413..281B} where high-energies
have been suppressed because they are generally not well constrained by the
observations. For simplicity we assume the same prompt emission spectrum for all
synthetic GRB, with $\alpha_{\mathrm{BAND}} = - 0.5$ and $E_{\mathrm{peak}} =
600$ \, keV, close to the average short GRB spectrum observed by Fermi/GBM
\citep{2014ApJS..211...12G}. We also assume fixed duration of the prompt
emission of $1 \, s$ and fixed isotropic equivalent luminosity of
$10^{50}~$erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$.

The principal source of uncertainty on rate of GRB detections associated with
the BNS mergers is the beaming factor of the prompt emission. We assume a fixed
beaming angle of 10 degrees \textcolor{blue}{when $\Gamma_{0} = 200$ according
  to what we have said?}. This angle is roughly compatible with the observations
of the total short GRB rate inferred from our BNS population.

\subsection*{Hard X-ray afterglows}

Although afterglows in the hard X-rays are rarely observed, it is not
unreasonable to assume that they are as frequent as gamma-rays, but observed
much less frequently due to observational limitations. The INTEGRAL satellite
(see next section) is well-suited for the observation of hard X-ray
afterglows. There are indications that such afterglows are present in the most
luminous GRBs occurring about once in few months (2\% of the sky observed by
INTEGRAL). For instance, GRB120711A was seen by ISGRI and JEM-X for about 8
hours \citep{2014A&A...567A..84M}. The bright hard X-ray emission afterglow
found to be related to the bright gamma-ray afterglow, observed by Fermi/LAT in
the energy range above 100 MeV with a consistent power-law spectrum with index
-2.

In this study, we assume that every BNS merger produces a hard X-ray afterglow
with a spectrum similar to GRB120711A, but rescaled to the total EM
luminosity of a typical short GRB - $10^{50}~$erg$^{-2}~$s$^{-1}$. We extrapolate
this spectrum to the off-axis case using Model~I in \citep{2016arXiv160606124P}.

\section*{The INTEGRAL mission and possible follow-up strategies}

The INTEGRAL satellite \citep{integral} carries a combination of pointing instruments (IBIS which
includes ISGRI, JEM-X, OMC and SPI), covering wide energy range from 3 keV to 10
MeV with a field of view up to 900 deg$^2$. SPI and IBIS are associated with
SPI-ACS and IBIS-Veto that are shields made of BGO scintillator with
sufficiently collecting area that they can be considered as instruments in their
own right.  This allows a \textit{passive} follow-up using the near all-sky
instruments SPI-ACS and IBIS-Veto and an \textit{active} follow-up where the
satellite is repointed.  In this study, we assume that every GW alerts is
followed actively.  Typical latency of INTEGRAL observations is about 1 day but
may be lower in some circumstances. We compute the flux at several moments of
time, and compare it with ISGRI sensitivity in 100~ks exposure.

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Prompt -- Passive follow-up}

    \caption{(\textit{Left}) Cumulative distribution of the

      run.(\textit{Right}) Cumulative distribution of the significance
      in the INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS instrument. \textcolor{blue}{Change figures}}
    \label{fluence_significance}
\end{figure}

Choosing an isotropic sky distribution for the passive follow-up emission (passive follow-up) 
of our GW events, \textcolor{blue}{we show that
in every case where the Earth is within the GRB emission cone,
INTEGRAL detects prompt emission with significance at least 50~sigma.
The rate of detection is 0.5 in the 6 months of O2 for GW alerts ($\mathrm{SNR} \geq 9$) 
and 0.1 in 6 months  in the case of 4-sigma GW events (SNR = 11.5).}

\subsection*{Afterglow -- Instrument repointing}

If we want to follow-up the afterglow emission, we will need to re-point the on-board instruments.
INTEGRAL can point only to a fraction of the GW localization region. For each
event we compute the total localization probability within the observable
region, and find that \textcolor{blue}{in 40\% of the cases 80\% of the localization is
observed. However, if the complete available region is followed up every
time, in total 80\% of the true source locations are covered.}

    lines correspond to the model assuming realistic distribution of short GRB luminosities. \textcolor{blue}{Change figures}}
    \label{covered_region}
\end{figure}

\textcolor{blue}{We find that the expected rate of 5~sigma detections is only about
0.01 events in 6 months of O2. We explore also another
possibility, that 10\% of the events launch much more energetic
outflow, in agreement with luminosities observed in real short
GRBs. In this case we expect about 0.1 events seen in 6 months.}

We stress that the afterglow prediction is particularly sensitive to
assumptions on rather uncertain source model, and we assume only
one, yet realistic, option.
