 \begin{abstract}
   By extrapolating the number of detections made during the first LIGO science
   run, tenths of gravitational wave signals from binary black hole mergers are
   anticipated in upcoming LIGO Virgo science runs. Finding an electromagnetic
   counterpart to compact binary merger events would be a landmark
   discovery. The search for such counterpart is challenging for a number of
   reasons, such as the poor resolution of source position reconstruction from
   the gravitational wave observations alone, and the weakness of the expected
   electromagnetic signal. In this poster, we evaluate the ability of current
   wide-field X- and gamma-ray telescopes aboard INTEGRAL to find such
   counterparts. We present the result of an end-to-end simulation for
   estimating the fraction of the sources that can be followed up, and the
   fraction of counterparts that can be detected based on different models.

\section*{Motivations}

\ECM{Intro on LIGO Virgo -- Objective of the study and major steps.}

\section*{Monte-Carlo simulation of gravitational-wave events from neutron-star binary mergers}

\ECM{Tell the number of sources, how they are distributed, summary plot?}

We used a catalogue of Milky Way-like galaxies in which populations of
$Z_{\astrosun}$ metallicity binary neutron stars (BNS) systems have been
simulated thanks to the Synthetic Universe database
\cite{dominik12:_doubl_compac_objec}. 

To do this we injected artificial GW signals corresponding to the coalescence of
the two compact objects into O2b anticipated detector noise.  We took the O2b
period to last for 3 months with a duty cycle of $50 \, \%$.

Finally, we try to recover these fake GW signals using matched-filtering
techniques thanks to the BAYESTAR pipeline \cite{PhysRevD.93.024013}.

As a sanity check we found the SNR, inclination and sky distribution of the
events to be qualitatively consistent with \cite{2016arXiv160606124P}.

% SNR threshold HL = 6 : RHO_thres_NETWORK = sqrt(rho_H**2 + rho_L**2) = 6
% On one hand, the signal only takes the inspiral phase into account via the use of non-spinning waveform 'TaylorF4ThreePN'.
% As we want to reproduce an analogue study with \textsc{INTEGRAL} it justifies why our simulation settings are aligned on their work. This will allow further comparisons.
% As a transition towards the details of the EM emission we estimated the total GW emitted energy $E_{\mathrm{EM}}$ of the simulated BNS systems thanks to Bernuzzi et al. \cite{2016PhRvD..94b4023B}, ie.  $E_{GW} \sim 1.5 \% \, M c^{2}$ where M is the total mass of the binary.

\section*{Electromagnetic emission model from neutron-star binary mergers}

\ECM{Tell: Connection BNS / Gamma-ray bursts, simplified GRB emission model with basic features}

Every simulated GW event is associated to a gamma-ray event.

Observational evidences of GRBs generally show two kinds of EM emissions : a
prompt emission in the gamma-ray or X-ray domain which corresponds to the
collimated ejection of relativistic jets of matter, and an afterglow emission in
the X-ray, optic or radio domain produced after the ejecta has been slowed down
by internally driven shocks between many layers.

\subsection*{Prompt emission}

\ECM{Tell: light curve evolution, isotropic emitted energy and beaming}

The prompt emission is well modelled by the BAND emission spectrum with the
following fixed parameters $\alpha_{\mathrm{BAND}} = - 0.5$,
$\beta_{\mathrm{BAND}} = - 2.25$ and $E_{\mathrm{peak}} = 800 \, MeV$. As it is
associated to the coalescence of the BNS it is not expected to last more than a
few seconds. 

\subsection*{Afterglow}

\ECM{Tell: light curve evolution, isotropic emitted energy and beaming}

As well the afterglow emission in the X-ray lasts until 3 days after the
coalescence of the BNS system and is modelled by a cut-off power law with
$\lambda = - 0.5$ and $E_{\mathrm{peak}} = 600 \, keV$. 

% Power law model see Eq(1) of 'THE FERMI GBM GAMMA-RAY BURST SPECTRAL CATALOG: FOUR YEARS OF DATA' - Gruber et al 

\begin{center}\vspace{.5cm}
    \includegraphics[width=20cm]{figures/spectra.png}
    \captionof{figure}{Prompt and afterglow emission spectra from SGRBs systems. Fluxes have been normalized with respect to the INTEGRAL finite energy band $\left[ 75 \, , 2000 \right] \, \mathrm{keV}$.}
    \label{spectra}
\end{center}

\section*{The INTEGRAL mission and possible follow-up strategies}

\ECM{Describe the relevant instruments here. Energy range covered. FOV.}

The EM follow-up strategy is partially determined by instrumental
performances. The INTEGRAL satellite embarks to instruments : the SPI- ACS
gamma-ray spectrometer and the IBIS imager. The former takes advantage of a very
wide field of view (FoV) essential to monitor prompt emissions (passive
follow-up) whereas the latter has a good enough spatial resolution once is is on
source (active follow-up).

% As GRBs will then be monitored thanks to the SPI-ACS and IBIS instruments embarked on the \textsc{INTEGRAL} satellite mission, we thus have to convert the energy information into some constraints acting on the detectable energy flux by those instruments. The emitted EM flux is hence truncated to the \textsc{INTEGRAL} finite energy band $\left[ 75 \, , 2000 \right] \, \mathrm{keV}$. \\

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Prompt -- Passive follow-up}

\begin{center}\vspace{.5cm}
    \includegraphics[scale=1.4]{figures/covered_region.png}
    \captionof{figure}{Cumulative distribution of the fraction of the LIGO/Virgo localization region accessible to INTEGRAL pointed follow-up observation in the LIGO/Virgo O2 run.}
    \label{covered_region}
\end{center}

Choosing an isotropic sky distribution of our GW events, we show that INTEGRAL
detects 55 \% of the events with a $20 \, \sigma$-significance for faint event
and 10 \% of the events with a $30 \, \sigma$-significance for loud events if
the aLIGO/Advanced Virgo network is considered.

We also show that it exists a sky region complementarity between the two onboard
instruments. Indeed, one has an excellent FoV whereas the other has a better
resolution. That is why we achieve with a better sensitivity combining the two.

\subsection*{Afterglow -- Instrument repointing}

As stated before the X-ray emission we investigate occurs until few days or
weeks after the prompt emission. It thus enable us to re-point the INTEGRAL
satellite and to align the IBIS instrument onto the source. The observation
strategy is then conditioned by two factors. The first one is the error-box area
covered by INTEGRAL at the prompt emission time. We decide from the right figure
?? we can trigger a follow-up if more than 30 \% of the error box is initially
covered.

The left figure brings an answer to the second question : what is the duration
limit after the prompt emission within which we are able to detect the SGRB
source ?

% \section*{Conclusions}

% Among compact objects populations GRBs are the most promising astrophysical
% sources from which we can expect a gamma-ray emission loud enough to be
% associated to GW radiation sources and thus be detectable with adequate
% instruments. We show in this poster that INTEGRAL is the appropriate to ensure a
% follow-up for both the prompt and afterglow emissions, thanks to the IBIS and
% SPI-ACES instruments.
